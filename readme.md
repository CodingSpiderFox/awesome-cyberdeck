## Overview

General overview about pocket computers and cyberdecks

## Open Hardware

### 

### DIY-Kits

These can be bought as a DIY set or different parts can be bought that then need to be assembled to complete the cyberdeck.

### DIY all-the-way

For these you cannot buy pre-manufactured casings and stuff at the point of adding them to this list. This might have changed in the meantime.
