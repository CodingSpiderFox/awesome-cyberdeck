## Overview

General overview about pocket computers and cyberdecks

- (TODO) [What is a cyberdeck](http://example.com) (link to a short description, maybe Wikipedia)
- (TODO) [History](http://example.com) (find good article) 

## Open Hardware

### 

### DIY-Kits

These can be bought as a DIY set or different parts can be bought that then need to be assembled to complete the cyberdeck.

### DIY all-the-way

For these you cannot buy pre-manufactured casings and stuff at the point of adding them to this list. This might have changed in the meantime.

### Articles

TODO

## Commercial

The commercially available products are listed here. 
Currently they are planned to be grouped by the price. 
TODO: maybe use a table to allow direct comparison of specs and features?
The prices might change (significantly in case of component "shortages" etc.)

### Below $100? 

- [Raspberry Pi-based?]() (find example)

### $100 - $300

- [ClockworkPi](https://www.clockworkpi.com/)

### $300 and above

## Accessories

### Crafting tools
To initially build and later extend/repair your device, some tools might be necessary
* A 3D-Printer
  * Look for a local makerspace so you don't have to buy one on your own
  * If there is no local makerspace - maybe this is the time for you to initiate one ;)
  * If you really think you need to own one: 
  * Filaments:
* Precision screwdrivers
* Drills
* Soldering/electronics tools
  * soldering iron + holder
  * solder wire
  * multimeter to check PCBs and components
  * Components
    * LEDs! Everyone loves LEDs.
    * Set of basic resistor values for 5V circuits
    * A handful of diodes, transistors
* Screws and nuts - sizes depend on the model you choose
