## Overview

General overview about pocket computers and cyberdecks

- [What is a cyberdeck](http://example.com) (link to a short description, maybe Wikipedia)
- [History](http://example.com) (find good article)

## Open Hardware

### DIY-Kits

These can be bought as a DIY set or different parts can be bought that then need to be assembled to complete the cyberdeck

### DIY all-the-way

For these you cannot buy pre-manufactured casings and stuff at the point of adding them to this list. This might have changed in the meantime


## Commercial

The commercially available products are listed here. 
Currently they are planned to be grouped by the price. 
TODO: maybe use a table to allow direct comparison of specs and features?
The prices might change (significantly in case of component "shortages" etc.)

### Below $100? 

- [Raspberry Pi-based?]() (find example)

### $100 - $300

### $300 and above

- [MNT Pocket Reform](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform)
